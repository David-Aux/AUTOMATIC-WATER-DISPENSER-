# AUTOMATIC-WATER-DISPENSER-
The Automatic Water Dispenser supplies water to any vessel in a controlled manner. The system uses an Arduino Uno to monitor water levels via a sensor, control a DC water pump through a MOSFET switch, and provide feedback via LEDs. The prototype shows how water can be automatically dispensed while ensuring the pump is protected from dry running.
